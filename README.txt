This is a web-project with django. The idea of this project was to made an order management web where you can see the services of the company, buy their products and contact them. You can log in the place and create an admin to manipulate the database (made in sqlite3), add, update and delete the things in it. I have used python with django, HTML and CSS with bootstrap. No matter that the project is finished, my idea is to continue putting some funcionalitites or updating some things.
